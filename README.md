# anniversary-processor

## General
I tend to forget anniversaries – birthdays, wedding days, etc. So I decided to write this little tool to keep the anniversaries on my mind – on all channels.

## Processors

### BASH/PowerShell
This prints anniversary data to your shell – you get an overview of current (-7d to +30d) events.

### HTML
This creates HTML files (one per month) containing all anniversaries within a calendar like table.

### PDF
This creates printable PDF versions of your HTML files

### ICAL
This creates .ics files for import to e.g. Thunderbird

## ToDo
* Improve this documentation (usage, details)
* Add samples for a quicker imagination
* Write tests!
* Refactor!
